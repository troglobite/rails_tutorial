# README

This repo is following the rails tutorial by michael hartl. It is using ruby 2.6.3 and rails 6.0.0. The tutorial states it covers rails 5.0.0. I was interested in learning rails 6 So i decided to try to translate to 6.0.0 but i may end up downgrading if it becomes too big of a headache.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
